         Produce a calling proxy that represents the content of all Obj type's mixins, but not the type itself. This is

             Produce a calling proxy that represents the content of all Obj type's mixins, but not the type itself. This is
             useful for redispatching **member** methods reimplemented on this type to a parent implementation:
             ```js
             function toString() {
               return this.super().toString() + ', x=' + this.x;

            ```
            
             To redispatch **static** methods, see {@link Type#super}.
            
             Note that this not the same as the language-specific `super` keyword because it works through the type system and
             supports multiple mixins. It behaves like the Python `super()` function, except called on the instance rather than
             globally.
            
             If `mixin` is the implementing type in a client implementation, this will delegate the call to the server.
             This can be used to create a local implementation "around" the server implementation for additional caching or
             other local state management.
