 *           .withArgs('1', '2')
 *           .returnValue("fake")
 *           .register()

 *
 * - Mock the action only when the claim function returns true

 * TestApi.spyOn(ctx, "FakeType", "fakeAction")

 *
 * Note that you cannot spy on Python stayInEngine calls -- calls between actions that claim the same
 * action requirement or where there is a runtime inheritance relationship between the claims. This is
 * because the Action Dispatcher will call the python function directly for stayInEngine calls
 * rather than go through the usual dispatching logic. This significantly reduces the latency of such calls.
 * See {@link understanding-action-engines.c3doc.md Understanding Action Engines} for details.
