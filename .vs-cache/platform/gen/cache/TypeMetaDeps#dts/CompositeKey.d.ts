// TypeScript definitions for the C3 type CompositeKey

/**
 *  The base type for defining composite keys to be used in place of the standard string "id" as the primary key for
 *  entity types as well as creating composite key fields to map multiple fields in a type to a key that can be used in
 *  fkey relationships with composite keys in other types.  The following 2 examples explain its usage:
 *
 * Type defining a composite key
 *
 * ```type
 * type MyTypeCompositeKey mixes CompositeKey {
 *
 *   field1: string
 *   field2: string
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Entity type with composite primary key.  Using the composite key as the PK ensures uniqueness and allows 1:m fkey
 * relationship from this type to another and a m:1 fkey relationship from that type back to this one.
 *
 * ```type
 * entity type MyType mixes MyTypeCompositeKey {
 *
 *   value: string
 *
 *   // Fkey array linking this type's composite PK (e.g. "id") to a composite key field in Foo.
 *   fooRef: [Foo](myTypeKey)
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Entity type with composite key field.  Using the composite key as a field in the type allows either 1:m or m:m fkey
 * relationships from this type to another type, depending on whether the key is unique in that type or not.  The key
 * fields are accessed as with any included type reference.
 *
 * ```type
 * entity type Foo {
 *
 *   value: string
 *
 *   // Composite key field
 *   myTypeKey: MyTypeCompositeKey
 *
 *   // M:1 Fkey field linking the myTypeKey composite key to the composite PK (e.g. "id") in Foo.
 *   myTypeRef: MyType(id, myTypeKey)
 * }
 *
 * ```
 * Entity type with composite key field and field mappings.  Using the composite key as a field in the type allows
 * either 1:m or m:m fkey relationships from this type to another type, depending on whether the key is unique in that
 * type or not.  It also assumes that the key fields are primarily accessed via the fields defined directly on "Foo"
 * (e.g. "zap" and "bar").
 *
 * ```type
 * entity type Foo {
 *
 *   zap:   string
 *   bar:   string
 *   value: string
 *
 *   // Composite key field that maps the key type's fields to the fields actually holding the key values in our type.
 *   @db(compositeKeyFieldMapping={field1: 'zap', field2: 'bar'})
 *   myTypeKey: MyTypeCompositeKey
 *
 *   // M:1 Fkey field linking the myTypeKey composite key to the composite PK (e.g. "id") in Foo.
 *   myTypeRef: MyType(id, myTypeKey)
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Note the use of {@link Ann.Db#compositeKeyFieldMapping} in the "Foo" type in this example.  This is used when the key
 * fields are defined in the type owning the key, as well as in the key. It maps individual fields in the composite key
 * type to the fields in "Foo" that actually hold the key values In this particular case it is mapping the field
 * "myTypeKey#field1" to the field "zap" and the field "myTypeKey#field2" to the field "bar".
 *
 * Also note that a type may have multiple usages of the same composite key type where each one would map to different
 * sets of fields.
 *
 * @remarks this represents a value passed to a method that expects an instance of CompositeKey
