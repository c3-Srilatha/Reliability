   * a.d.e = 'hello' // 3
   * a.b.pop(); // 4

   *   1. when the field `b` changed - the FieldPath will be "b[1]".
   *   2. when the field `c` changed - the FieldPath will be "c.hello".
   *   3. when `d` changed - the FieldPath will be "d.e".
   *   4. when the field `b` changed by removing an element - the FieldPath will be "b[1]".
   *
   * `D.onChange` should be called once - the FieldPath will be `e`.
   *
