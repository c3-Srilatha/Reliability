// TypeScript definitions for the C3 type Generic

/**
 * Some metadata types can be explicitly parametrized by specifying placeholder variables and using those in place of
 * explicit value types. A type which has "variables" that are not "bound" to values is said to be "generic", because
 * it has not yet been fully specified or narrowed.
 *
 * Once a generic type has all its variables bound to concrete value types, it is no longer generic. Generic type
 * variable can be bound to a different variable with a different name. In this case type will continue to be generic.
 *
 * Note that binding may be done explicitly resulting in a new named type:
 * ```
 * type type NormTimeseriesDouble mixes NormTimeseries<double>
 * ```
 * This creates an entirely new type with a new name that is no longer generic.
 *
 * Binding may also be performed at runtime:
 * ```java
 * Type t = NormTimeseries.bindVar(PrimitiveType.ofDbl);
 * ```
 * This also creates a non-generic type, but without a separate name. Its name includes the parametric binding:
 * "NormTimeseries<double>".
 *

 * @see FunctionType
