    """
    This type is a KvStore which stores data in a directory like structure using a FileSystem.
    The specific FileSystem used as the backing store will be the one configured (FileSystem.inst())
    Data for the KvStore will be stored under the mount {@link FileSystemMount.KEY_VALUE} for the configured file system
    
    Data values will be written into individual files. The specific file extensions depends on the utilized FileSystem.
    The structure in which entries are stored are as followed for a configured FileSystem.
    which does not support contentTypeEncoding.
    ```
    {KEY_VALUE}/tableName/<encoded_id>/<encoded_col1>.json
    {KEY_VALUE}/tableName/<encoded_id>/<encoded_col2>.json
    {KEY_VALUE}/tableName/<encoded_id>/<encoded_col3>.byt
    ```
    
    i.e
    if we put the following type into the KvStore
    ```
    {"type" : "Foo", "id": 0123, "BarA": true, "BarB": 17, "BarC": ByteBuffer.wrap("address".getBytes())},
    ```

    {KEY_VALUE}/Foo/0123/___z_self.json

    {KEY_VALUE}/Foo/0123/BarB.json
