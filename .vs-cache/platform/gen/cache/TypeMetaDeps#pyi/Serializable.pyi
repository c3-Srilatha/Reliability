    Base type for serializable values. This serialization uses {@link https://www.json.org/json-en.html JSON} format.
    
    Serialization must include enough information to deserialize the value as the correct type. For example,
    {@link Obj} serialization includes the type name as "type" in the JSON object and `any` and `anyof` values are
    serialized by boxing using the {@link Boxed} instance.
