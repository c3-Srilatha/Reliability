    A {@link FlowGraph} is a directed port graph, where each vertex distinguishes between input and output ports. Input
    ports are single-input, whereas output ports may be multi-output. Every edge is directed, connecting from the
    output port of a vertex to the input port of another vertex. A {@link FlowGraph} is good for representing a conceptual
    flow, or procedure, of steps. The vertices could represent C3 actions with inputs and output, or they could represent
    a higher-level concept, like steps in an ML model.

    Optimized double-linked-list-like data structure for traversing next and previous vertices. See {@link #precomputeVertexConnections}

    Outer map:
    Key - vertex string id
    Value - mapping of ports to vertices, i.e. "Inner map"
    
    Inner map:
    Key - port string name
    Value - [vertex string id for vertices connected to port]

        Central type for functional-style authoring of a {@link FlowGraph}. Functional-style authoring is port-centric. In
        other words, it is expressed a series of "transformations" on a starting (i.e. input) port(s). In the background,
        there is metadata tracking the transformations in order to build a graph.
        
        NOTE: One key property of functional-style authoring is that ports are immutable. This allows for different graphs
        to be built off of the same port instances. One example user flow where this is particularly useful is during experimentation,
        where a user often needs to backtrack and start from earlier points in a graph. With functional authoring, a user can
        go back to earlier "checkpoints" without re-executing any authoring commands. Naturally, this comes at a cost of
        duplication (which would not be incurred by e.g. a mutable builder pattern), so this style of authoring is most suited
        for graphs that are relatively small.

             Note that this not the same as the language-specific `super` keyword because it works through the type system and
             supports multiple mixins. It behaves like the Python `super()` function, except called on the instance rather than
             globally.
            
             If `mixin` is the implementing type in a client implementation, this will delegate the call to the server.
             This can be used to create a local implementation "around" the server implementation for additional caching or
             other local state management.
