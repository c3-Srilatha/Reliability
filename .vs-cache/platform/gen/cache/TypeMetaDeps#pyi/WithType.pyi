     Produce a calling proxy that represents the content of all Obj type's mixins, but not the type itself. This is
     useful for redispatching **member** methods reimplemented on this type to a parent implementation:
     ```js
     function toString() {
       return this.super().toString() + ', x=' + this.x;
     }
     ```
    
     ```py
     def toString(this):
        return this.super().toString() + ', x=' + this.x
    ```
    
     To redispatch **static** methods, see {@link Type#super}.
    
     Note that this not the same as the language-specific `super` keyword because it works through the type system and
     supports multiple mixins. It behaves like the Python `super()` function, except called on the instance rather than
     globally.
    
     If `mixin` is the implementing type in a client implementation, this will delegate the call to the server.
     This can be used to create a local implementation "around" the server implementation for additional caching or
     other local state management.
