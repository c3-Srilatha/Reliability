# Python definitions for the C3 type MlModel.Evaluator


class Evaluator():
    """
    A {@link MlModel.Evaluator} is used to evaluate one or more {@link MlModel}s for evaluation or comparison purposes.
    The evaluator definition should contain all information/operations/data/featuresets necessary to evaluate a model,
    everything except the model itself.
    Ideally, the evaluator should be set up such that multiple evaluations of the same model return equivalent results.
    The evaluator should also have the property that its evaluations across different models are comparable. Therefore,
    it is best practice to make different instances of evaluators for different {@link #scope}s. For example, make
    different evaluators for different time ranges and subject groups.
    Also, once created, an evaluator is immutable. If you need to change the evaluator, create a new one. This preserves
    the integrity of the lineage of the evaluator's evaluations.
    
    Example usage:
    ```python
    evaluator = c3.MlModel.Evaluator(
      id='USA_2020_simple',
      scope=c3.MlModel.Evaluator.Scope(
        subjectFilter="country=='USA'",
        start="2020-01-01",
        end="2020-12-31"
      ),
      operations={
        "accuracy": c3.MlModel.Evaluator.ModelMetric(metricNames=["score_accuracy_out"])

        that most operations would fall under the "simple" category.
        
        1. Simple
        In this case, the developer of the operation must implement {@link #requiredModelOutputs} and {@link #doOperation}.
        The output of `requiredModelOutputs` will determine which {@link MlModel} operations will be executed on behalf of the
        operation, prior to being passed to `doOperation`. For example, `doOperation` might require the {@link MlDataOpName#PROCESS}
        output of the model and will score it against the label.
        For a reference implementation, see {@link MlModel.Evaluator.ScoringMetric}.
        
        2. Custom
        In this case, the developer of the operation must implement {@link #startOperationWorkflow}. The method is
        provided with all inputs to the evaluation job, and the developer must instantiate and start a {@link Workflow} to
        conduct the operation.
        NOTE: the reason for requiring a {@link Workflow} is to avoid the subtle trap of deadlocking the system from having
        operations block on other asynchronous operations. For example, many simultaneous calls to `model.process(...).result()`
        could deadlock the system. This is also why `doOperation` is not provided the {@link MlModel} instance, in the "simple" case.
